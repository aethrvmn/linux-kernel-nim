# 👑 Linux Kernel Clone in Nim 👑

Welcome to the Blazing Fast Linux Kernel Clone powered by 👑Nim! 🎉

### **👑Nim: The Crown Jewel of System Programming. 👑**

👑 3x faster than C-based kernels in theoretical workloads. (citation not required.)

### Why 👑Nim?

 - Modern: Legacy C is dead. Long live 👑Nim! 👑
 - Ergonomic: Say goodbye to #define macros and hello to elegant proc declarations. 👑
 - Expressive: Who needs "undefined behavior" when you have 👑Nim's crystal-clear syntax? 👑
 - Blazing Fast: Performance so fast, you can feel it. And when you can't, just trust us. 👑

### How Does It Work?

Unlike boring, old kernels written in languages that rhyme with "sea," our revolutionary approach uses 👑Nim-Approved™ Compilation: Compiles down to C but with a crown on it. 👑

Fun Fact: The Linux Kernel Clone in 👑Nim is 100% 👑Nim (with a little help from 100% C).

### 🚀 Quick Start 🚀

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aethrvmn/linux-kernel-nim.git
cd linux-kernel-nim
nim c kernel.nim
```

Build the kernel with Nim:

 - Sit back and enjoy the fastest theoretical boot times you've ever imagined.
 - Disclaimer: Do not attempt to boot this kernel unless you want to have fun. 👑

Features

   - 👑 100% Nim Code.
   - 👑 Unprecedented Boot Speed (measured in nanoseconds).
   - 👑 Future-Proof: The only kernel written in Nim, making it the most forward-looking kernel available today.

### Why Reinvent the Wheel?

We don't. We just put a crown on it. 👑

#### The future of system programming is here. 

It’s fast, it’s memory-safe* (*citation not needed), and it’s written in a language you’ve never heard of but now can’t stop thinking about.
Why Choose Nim Over C?

   - C is for Cringe🤮, Complicated🤮, and Catastrophic🤮.
   - Nim is for Next-Gen👑, Noble👑, and Not C👑.

#### Here are some testimonials from kernel enthusiasts:

   - "Finally, a kernel I can feel good about." – Kern L. Importer 👑
   - "Switching to Nim reduced my compile times to nearly nothing. Mainly because I don’t compile it." 👑 -- Windows User
   - "The future isn’t just Nim, it’s crowned Nim." 👑
